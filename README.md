--- Preparation ----

Make sure you have NodeJS with 'npm' installed.
Also download and install Mongodb.

--- Installation ---

Download all project files and put them in a directory.
Go to the project directory in your command line and type 'npm install' to install
project specific dependencies automatically.

--- Startup ---

Startup your configured Mongodb with command 'mongod'.
In an other command line tab, go to the project directory and type 'node server.js' to
start the node server locally.

Now access index.html by opening the file in a browser from the project directory.
